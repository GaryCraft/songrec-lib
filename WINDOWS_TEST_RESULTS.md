8. **‚úÖ Cross-platform Audio**: CPAL integration works on Windows

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

1. **M4A Format Support**: Limited support due to codec availability in Rust audio libraries on Windows
   - **Workaround**: Convert M4A files to WAV or MP3 format
   - **Technical Note**: This is a limitation of the underlying `rodio` audio library

### üéØ Recommended Usage on Windows

#### Supported Audio Formats (Tested & Working)
